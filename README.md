## Overview

The Hotel Management System is a web platform designed to manage hotel operations.
The application includes features like user registration and authentication, booking management, room management, payment processing for bookings and services, as well as guest feedback management.
The system supports different roles, such as hotel administrators, registered users, and employees, providing each with a personalized interface.

The primary goal of the system is to facilitate the daily operations of the hotel, improve customer experience, and offer a centralized system for the administration to manage operations like bookings, rooms, and hotel services.

In addition to core functionalities like booking and room management, the Hotel Management System also enables staff and employee management, covering daily tasks such as housekeeping and room maintenance.
Employees have access to a dedicated panel where they can view and update the status of their tasks.

The platform also integrates payment systems, allowing users to securely and easily make payments for various hotel bookings and services.
Furthermore, guest feedback and review management is integrated to enhance communication and customer experience, allowing administrators to monitor feedback and improve services accordingly.

The system is flexible and scalable, supporting additional features like analytical reports for hotel performance, booking statistics, and room occupancy rates, making it a powerful tool for optimizing hotel management and increasing operational efficiency.

Within the admin dashboard, the system also offers detailed statistics displayed through charts, helping monitor hotel performance.
These statistics can include monthly booking counts, most-used services, revenue from bookings and services, and room occupancy rates.
These charts provide administrators with a visual overview, helping them make more informed decisions and optimize hotel resource management.
